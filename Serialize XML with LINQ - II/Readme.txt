LINQ | LINQ to XML | XML DOM
----------------------------

LINQ to XML is like the Document Object Model (DOM) in that it brings the XML 
document into memory. You can query and modify the document, and after you modify 
it you can save it to a file or serialize it and send it over the Internet. 
However, LINQ to XML differs from DOM:

- It provides a new object model that's lighter weight and easier to work with.
- It takes advantage of language features in C# and Visual Basic.

The query capability of LINQ to XML is comparable in functionality 
(although not in syntax) to XPath and XQuery
